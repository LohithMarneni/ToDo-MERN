</p>
This ToDo list application is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) to provide users with an intuitive interface to manage their tasks. Users can create, update, delete, and mark tasks as completed, helping them stay organized. The backend is powered by Express.js and Node.js, offering a REST API for managing task data, which is stored in MongoDB. The frontend, built with React, provides a responsive design, making it accessible on both desktop and mobile devices. The application is scalable and can easily integrate additional features such as user authentication, task categorization, and priority settings.

Furthermore, this project demonstrates the power of full-stack development with modern tools, enhancing skills in API development, database management, and React-based UI creation.
